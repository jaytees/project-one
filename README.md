# One - Organising the Outreach

## Purpose of the site

There is a big issue surrounding the Australian bushfire support. People are donating locally, to community centres and clubs. But they are struggling to handle the volume and organising where the donations are actually going. I hope to make this easier.

## Aim of the site

* Doners will know what products are most in demand
* Doners will know when to buy goods
  * When / where collections are orgainised
  * When / where they are being delivered
* Doners know what locations are highest in demand
* Doners know products other people are donation so don't over buy

## Style

* Bright / cheerful
* Soft around the edges
